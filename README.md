# Engineered_CAR-T
The work started from engineering CAR-T trogocytosis activity for a delivery purpose, but intrinsic limitation forced Xinyi to focus on the biological implications of the phenomenon they observed rather than delivery. There is a new direction---using trogocytosis for recording cell-cell interaction history. This can be my independent project here!
